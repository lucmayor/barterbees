    <p>BarterBee is an app that connects students who are looking to learn a new skill, further build on a skill they might already possess, or just make meaningful and productive connections. The app matches students with one another based on skills described as “what I offer” and “what I am looking for”.</p>

    <p>Our app operates on the basis of allowing students to exchange their own services with the services of other students. Our target audience is students in a college/university setting. Students list the services they can provide, as well as the ones they are currently seeking. Students can connect with others and find meaningful service exchange opportunities when both parties see potential value in a trade. Ideally, this results in a connection that leads to an in-person meeting or a mutually chosen video conference method at times when distance may be a limiting factor. All students using BarterBee should ideally have a skill to offer and seek a service in an area where they lack the skills, knowledge, or tools to fulfil it alone. However, if a student has no skills to offer, BarterBee defaults the 'What I Offer' option to 'Looking to make new connections,' ensuring that everyone is welcome to use BarterBee.</p>
        
    <p>The cost of hiring an individual for every service is not a financial possibility for many people given the current economic conditions, regardless of whether they are capable of providing it for themselves. Our project is a valuable solution that eases the financial burden on students when accessing both necessary services and luxuries that may have been previously difficult to budget for. Furthermore, our project seeks to rebuild a culture of cooperation and create a community of people that provides a sense of belonging, a sense of support, and a sense of identity. It also encourages students to develop diverse skill sets outside the conventional classroom setting. Our project makes skill-building more accessible, practical, and enjoyable. As a whole, we are allowing individuals to use their skills to empower our community that may not have been able to afford their service or to simply build rapport with others who may have further knowledge or expertise in their specialised domain.</p>
        
    <p>The project would be deemed successful based on four criteria. The first success criterion is that the app gets 100 downloads within the first four months of its release. The second success criterion is that BarterBee retains 40 active users for two consecutive months, where active users are defined as those who visit the app at least three times weekly. The third criterion is the average rating of all interactions/matches in the first four months to be at least 3.5/5. We will measure such by supplying a survey to every user asking them to rate an interaction/match after completion. Lastly, and most importantly, we will be measuring the percentage of successful meetings against the total successful matches, with a target success rate of 70%. A successful meeting will be defined as a meeting that occurs within a mutually agreed-upon timeframe, with both parties confirming the exchange was completed as planned. We will track this through user feedback, where both participants rate the meeting outcome and confirm whether the skill exchange was completed as expected.</p>
